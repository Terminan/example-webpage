# example-webpage

This project exists to practice my skills in HTML and CSS based on the Foundations course from The Odin Project.
By the end of this project, I will have built an example webpage that will emulate the page found at https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png.
